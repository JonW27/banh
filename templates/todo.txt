TODO:
* Add support for keymapping stuff, like tables (put in settings)
* create markdown tables button
* for documents, allow LaTeX files to be used for setting formatting
* allow rules to be set for files matching X criteria
* create quick cheatsheet link (keymap + link), work similar to spotlight
* allow markdown file inputs
* list nesting should decrement if backspace is pressed
* editor should include line numbers, word count, estimated reading time
* enable really large nesting (pdflatex currently fails to do so)
* use dragstart property to allow dragging of files (lazy)
* version control
* keyboard shortcuts for template files
